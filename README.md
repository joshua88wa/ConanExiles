# Funcom Conan Exiles Dedicated Server Settings
The default settings for the Conan Exiles Dedicated Server are way too confusing to me and some of the settings are missing, so I am trying to fix that.

Setting file location is `../../../ConanSandbox/Saved/Config/WindowsServer`

[HaruHost](https://haruhost.com/) may save files in `../../../ConanSandbox/Saved/Config`
